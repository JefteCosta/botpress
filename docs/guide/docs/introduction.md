Building chatbots is a new, exciting challenge for most developers. Creating software that holds a conversation and responds naturally to humans is a thrilling possibility, and Botpress is turning this into reality. 

The problem is that you wouldn't want to spend hundreds of hours learning and putting together all the infrastructure and boilerplate code required to get a conversational backend up and running. Luckily, you don't have to.

## What is Botpress

> A **lightweight**, **fast**, and **flexible** chatbot building framework that you can host anywhere, whether it be on the cloud or on-premise.

Botpress is a complete platform that ships with all the tools you need to build, deploy and manage production-grade bots in record time. Here are some of the components that are installed by default:

- An **NLU Engine** for intent detection and variable extraction.
- An **administration interface** that can be viewed from a browser, to manage and monitor your instances, bots and users.
- A **visual workflow builder** to create conversation flow and workflow automations.

- Support for **popular messaging channels** like Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Microsoft Teams, and others.

## Why Botpress

Botpress has many advantages over other platforms and frameworks:

- It runs **fully on-premise**, so you can host it on a server of your choice, giving you full control over the data that comes in and out.
The Botpress platform's core is **open-source** with thousands of GitHub contributors and will be free forever.
- The platform is extremely **flexible** and developer-friendly.
- **Zero** external dependencies, making it the only fully featured chatbot building platform

## How to build a chatbot

There are three main steps involved in creating chatbots.

Developers start by **Building** a chatbot, which consists of adding the required messaging channels, integrating the necessary backend components and applications your chatbot will need to interact with, and creating conversation workflows.

Once done, you'll need to **Deploy** your chatbot somewhere, which could be on a cloud server or on-premise.

Finally, you'll give other people access to your chatbot so they can **Manage** it once it is in use. Managing a chatbot entails analyzing the conversations, refining the conversational experience by building new workflows, and making it smarter by continuously improving the NLU.
