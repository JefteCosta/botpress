## Requirements

Messenger requires you to have a Facebook App and a Facebook Page to set up your chatbot connection to their platform.

### Create a Facebook App
To fulfill this, log in to your Facebook account. Please ensure that this Facebook account has admin rights for the Facebook page to which you desire to connect the chatbot.

Thereafter go to the [Facebook for Developers website](https://developers.facebook.com/), select "My Apps" from the top menu, and create a new app. For more details and assistance, visit the [Facebook developer documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development)

### Facebook Page
This step is only required if you do not already have a Facebook page to link your chatbot. [You can find details on how to create a new Facebook page here](https://www.facebook.com/pages/creation/).

Please note that if you link your chatbot to a pre-existing page, you must have an administrator or developer role on that page. Without such a privilege, you will be unable to link your Facebook app to your Facebook page.

### HTTPS Endpoint to your bot
Facebook only integrates its apps and services to secured endpoints. This means that you are mandatorily required to create such an endpoint to your chatbot. If your chatbot already has such an endpoint, you can skip this step. However, below are two tutorials to help you create an HTTPS endpoint if you do not have one.
  
  - Create an HTTPS tunnel to your machine using Ngrok. [**Tutorial**](https://api.slack.com/tutorials/tunneling-with-ngrok)
  - Using Nginx and Let's Encrypt. This tutorial is based on the Linux Ubuntu 16.04 Operating System. [**Tutorial**](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04)
  - Use Serveo to create an HTTPS tunnel to your machine. [**Tutorial**](https://medium.com/automationmaster/how-to-forward-my-local-port-to-public-using-serveo-4979f352a3bf)  

## Setup

### Enable the Messenger Channel

You can do this by opening the file `data/global/botpress.config.json` in a text editor and setting the value to `true` as below. 

"`js
"modules": [
  ...
    {
      "location": "MODULES_ROOT/channel-messenger",
      "enabled": true
    },
```

### Get App Secret & Verify Token

#### App Secret
- Go to your Facebook App
- In the left sidebar, expand the Settings menu and select Basic. Here you can find the App ID and App Secret.
- Click on the "Show" button in the "App Secret" text box. You can copy the "App Id" and "App Secret" to use for your Facebook API calls.

#### Verify Token
You can set a long string of your own making as a verify token or use a random string generator service like random.org to create a verify token.

## Configurations
The following configurations are required for the connection to be established to enable you to access your chatbot from your Facebook page. 

While the first three are mandatory, the last three configurations (greeting text, get started, and persistent menu) are not.


### Botpress HTTPS Endpoint 
- Head over to `data/global/config/channel-messenger.json`. If it doesn't exist, restart Botpress Server.

- Set the following properties:
  - `appSecret`. You will find this value on your Facebook App page.
  - `verifyToken`. This is a random string you need to generate and keep secret. You'll need to copy/paste this token in the Facebook App portal when setting up your webhook.

- Make sure you have an HTTPS URL pointing to your Botpress Server and set the `EXTERNAL_URL'environment variable as follows:
  - Open `data/global/botpress.config.json` and set the value of the `
httpServer.externalUrl` configuration variable to the complete hostname of your HTTPS endpoint, for example, `https://bot.botpress.com`. The resulting file should be as below:
"`json
  {
  "$schema": "../botpress.config.schema.json",
  "httpServer": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 3000,
    "backlog": 0,
    "bodyLimit": "10mb",
    "cors": {
      "enabled": true
    },
    "externalUrl": "https://bot.botpress.com",
```    
    - Restart Botpress Server to reload the configuration

### Individual Chatbot Configuration

Head over to `data/bots/<your_bot>/config/channel-messenger.json` and create the file if it doesn't exist. If it doesn't exist, copy & paste the content of the **global** `channel-messenger.json` file and prefix the `$schema` property with an additional `../` to point to the correct schema.

> **Important:** One bot is connected to **one** facebook page.

You will need to set up the following properties:

- `accessToken` has to be set to your [Page Access Token](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started/app-setup). [Official Reference](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens#pagetokens)
- `enabled` has to be set to `true`
- `appSecret`. You will find this value on your Facebook App page.
- `verifyToken`. This is a random string you need to generate and keep secret. You'll need to copy/paste this token in the Facebook App portal when setting up your webhook.
- Make sure you have an HTTPS URL pointing to your Botpress Server and set the [`EXTERNAL_URL`](../advanced/configuration#exposing-your-bot-on-the-internet) environment variable
- Restart Botpress Server to reload the configuration

Read the [config definition file](https://github.com/botpress/botpress/blob/master/modules/channel-messenger/src/config.ts) to learn more about configurations.

> All changes to the configuration will take effect on `onBotMount`. To refresh the configuration at runtime, you can disable and enable the bot again without restarting the server.

### Facebook Webhook
Messenger will use a webhook that you'll need to register to communicate with your bot.

1. In your Facebook app, go to Products > Messenger > Settings > Webhooks > Setup Webhooks
2. Under Callback URL, enter your secured public URL and make sure to point to the `/webhook` endpoint.
3. Paste your `verifyToken` (the random string you generated) in the Verify Token field.
4. Make sure `messages` and `messaging_postbacks` are checked in Subscription Fields.

> **‚≠ê Note**: When you set up your webhook, Messenger requires a **secured public** address. To test on localhost, we recommend using services like [pagekite](https://pagekite.net/), [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) or [tunnelme](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) to expose your server.

### Greeting Text
"`json
"greeting": "Hello, I'm your bot!"
```

Your bot's Messenger profile's greeting property allows you to specify the greeting message people will see on your bot's welcome screen. The welcome screen is displayed for people interacting with your bot for the first time.

Read more about [greeting](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/reference/messenger-profile-api/greeting).

### Get Started
```json
"getStarted": "<GET_STARTED_PAYLOAD>"
```

The Get Started button will allow you to send a pro-active message once it is clicked on the Facebook Messenger chat interface. The Page Messenger welcome screen displays this Get Started button. When this button is tapped, the Messenger Platform will send a messaging_postbacks event to your webhook. Pages that add the button may also configure their greeting text.

Read more about [get started](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/reference/messenger-profile-api/get-started-button).

### Persistent Menu
The persistent menu allows you to have an always-on user interface element inside Messenger conversations. This is an easy way to help people discover and access your Messenger bot's core functionality at any point in the conversation.

Read more about persistent menu [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/send-messages/persistent-menu).

> The persistent menu is cached locally on the user's client, but updates are fetched periodically. If you change the persistent menu, it can take some time for the menu to update. You can force a refresh by deleting the conversation and starting a new one.

**Persistent Menu object example**:

```json
 "persistentMenu": [
    {
      "locale": "default",
      "call_to_actions": [
        {
          "title": "My Account",
          "type": "nested",
          "call_to_actions": [
            {
              "title": "Pay Bill",
              "type": "postback",
              "payload": "PAYBILL_PAYLOAD"
            },
            {
              "type": "web_url",
              "title": "Latest News",
              "url": "https://www.messenger.com/",
              "webview_height_ratio": "full"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```
## Configuration Example

Below is a configuration example showing how your `channel-messenger.json` may look after complete configuration in `botpress-vxx\data\global\config`

"`json
{
  "$schema": "../../assets/modules/channel-messenger/config.schema.json",
  "enabled": false,
  "appSecret": "5d789e4cvmlbvfbflb3efd68407d97942ecbf4fc0af",
  "verifyToken": "KjhkjyHAusOPOYYGIijoijpoij",
  "persistentMenu": [],
  "chatUserAuthDuration": "24h"
}
```

You will also  need to add a configuration file in the directory of the chatbot you wish to connect to Messenger `botpress-vxx\data\bots\<your_bot>\config`

```
{
  "$schema": "../../assets/modules/channel-web/config.schema.json",
  "showBotInfoPage": true,
  "infoPage": {
    "enabled": true
  },
}
```
